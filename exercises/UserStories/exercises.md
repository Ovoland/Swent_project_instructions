# User stories and personas

## Exercise 1
Welcome to your new job at SuperQuiz, the trendy app that allows everyone to create and share quizzes!
Your first task is to add a new feature.
Here is a transcript from part of a conversation with a user:

> Hey! So you're the developer of this quiz app?
> The one where I can write questions and answers for my friends?
> I think it's cool, but I can't use it as much as I want to...
> 
> I'm a firefighter, I don't have time for this app during the day,
> and when I come home, I have plenty to do, cook, clean, ...
> When I do these tasks I'm busy, not like when I'm watching TV.
> I don't always have my phone in hand! Sometimes I even forget where I put it.
> Maybe if one could use the app with voice it would work?
> With that, I could create quizzes while cooking!
> Otherwise, I can't use the app much.

Write a user story, in a single sentence using the classical format, that summarizes this conversation:

> As a ... I want to ... So that ...

Your story must contain all necessary information and only that information.

## Exercise 2

You are working for a startup that develops a university management app.
You just received a description of what the app should do:

> This app will be the administrative backbone of the university.
> Almost all staff will use it.
>
> Human Resources will register each student, including their personal details,
> and use the system to ensure each student follows the rules concerning the duration of studies,
> the number of courses that must be taken, the payment of all applicable fees...
> Professors will use the app to input grades and to send informational messages to students in their courses.
> Students will be able to see the list of courses, register for a course, and see their grades.
> Students will also be able to pay fees and update their personal details from the app.
> Staff members will also be able to update their personal details, including their banking coordinates for their salary.

Your task is to extract user stories from this description, by thinking about what each kind of user might want from this app.

This exercise does not have an exact solution; try to write at least 4 stories.

## Exercise 3
You are developing in a team a recipe management and culinary inspiration app.

You had given your intern the task of creating "personas" for your users, but it seems the intern has not quite followed the software engineering course,
because the resulting personas are as follows:

> Ana, manager, doesn't have the time to look at many recipes nor to do the shopping every day
>
> Bumi, computer science student, only cooks a few times a week and prefers non-spicy food
>
> Cath, amateur cook, loves to cook.

What can you say about each of these personas? Should they be changed, and if so, how?

## Exercise 4

You founded a startup with your friends to revolutionize libraries.
Your startup will let people fill a quiz to determine their profile,
then receive books each month corresponding to their preferences.
To enable this, you will have a website on which users will be able to fill this quiz, pay, and update their coordinates.

What personas could you think of for this app?

This exercise has no exact solution ; try to create at least 2.

# Solutions: User stories and personas

## Exercise 1
### Evaluation criteria
- The user story must be in the right shape, with 3 components
- The user story must contain enough details to summarize the transcript
- The user story must not contain useless or irrelevant details such as the fact the person is a firefighter


### Suggested solution
> As someone who multi-tasks,
> I want to create and answer quizzes only with my voice,
> so that I can play with my friends while my hands are busy doing something else.

## Exercise 2
### Evaluation criteria
- The stories must be in the correct format, with 3 components each
- The stories must be for specific kinds of users, such as "student" or "professor"
- The stories must be specific enough that a developer could think of implementing them


### Suggested solution
> As an HR person, I want to register a new staff member, so that I can pay their salary.

> As an HR person, I want to unregister a staff member, so that I don't pay somebody who has quit.

> As a professor, I want to send grades by uploading a single file for a course, so that I don't have to repeat the same action for 100s of students.

> As a professor, I want to send an immediate notification to all students in my course, so that I can warn them about last-minute room or scheduling changes.

> As a student, I want to see a list of all courses, so that I can choose which ones to take.

> As a student, I want to search for courses in a specific area, so that I can see ones that are relevant to me.

> As a student, I want to get a notification when I get a new grade, so that I don't have to look at the app every day just in case.

> As a staff member, I want to see my salary certificates, so that I can declare my taxes.

> As a staff member, I want to change my name, so that I can use my display name rather than my full legal name.

## Exercise 3
### Evaluation criteria
- The decisions must be justified
- The decisions must make sense, but this is not useful if they do not also have a good justification


### Suggested solution
"Ana" is a good persona. (She could lead to features such as "show a random set of recipes" and "find recipes based on ingredients you have at home")

"Bumi" seems like more of a real concrete person than a persona, he has many details that aren't related to the app, such as doing computer science.
The idea of a "student" persona could be useful, for instance representing users who have a tight budget and who want "meal prep" kinds of recipes.

"Cath" is way too vague to be useful. She needs many more details.

## Exercise 4
### Evaluation criteria

- The personas must have a name and a 1-2 sentence description
- The personas must be abstract enough to represent a group of users
- The personas must be specific enough that a development team could use them in user stories


### Suggested solution

> Andie, huge fan of reading, reads >10 books a month and knows exactly what kind of books she likes.

> Boubacar, occasional reader, likes discovering new genres of books.

> Chen, manager who travels frequently, wants books to read in the plane but is often not home to get packages.

> Deirdre, pensioner, reads a lot but isn't sure your startup can figure out what she wants to read.

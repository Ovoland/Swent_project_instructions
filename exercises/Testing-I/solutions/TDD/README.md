# Test-Driven Development

You can find the proposed implementation of the vector class
in [`Vector3.kt`](src/main/kotlin/Vector3.kt).
Note that this is only one of the many ways to implement this class.

The tests associated with the implementation can be found
in [`Vector3Test.kt`](src/test/kotlin/Vector3Test.kt).

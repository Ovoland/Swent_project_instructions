# Coverage Scenarios in Software Testing

This exercise aims to illustrate the principles of different types of code coverage through real-life analogies. Understanding these coverage types will help ensure comprehensive testing of software applications.

## Case 1

Imagine you are a safety inspector for a building company, tasked with ensuring that all safety protocols are followed during construction. You should inspect _each decision point_ where safety measures vary based on certain conditions. For example, inspect safety for employees working under fluctuating weather conditions, at different heights, and with varying equipment.

## Case 2

Consider you are a detective inspecting a series of events leading to a car crash. You need to reconstruct and analyze _all possible sequences of actions and events_ that could have led to the collision. This includes factors like weather, road condition, driver alcohol level, speeding, vehicle condition, and potential mechanical failures.

## Case 3

Imagine you are a medical device tester tasked to ensure the accuracy and reliability of a blood glucose monitoring system. This system consists of hardware components like the glucose meter and software components for display. Your goal is to ensure that each function and feature operates as intended, and every line of code related to glucose measurement, data storage, and UI interaction is executed at least once.

## Other exercise you can do on your own

You could further practice on implementing [Tic Tac Toe](https://kata-log.rocks/tic-tac-toe-kata) and [Fizz Buzz](https://kata-log.rocks/fizz-buzz-kata) using TDD. 
No solutions are provided though, but it's good to practice the idea of TDD since the above two cases have well defined requirements.
